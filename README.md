# Badger Accordion
An accessible vanilla JS accordion with extensible API


## The Idea
 - To make an accessible, animated, accordion with an extensible API
 - Make it using just plain vanilla JS
 - Ensure that it has just plain simple css


## Basic Setup

Add Javascript & CSS
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/accordion.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/accordion.css"/>
```

Just need to initalise a new instance of the accordion.
```
    const accordion = new
```
